# Payment Management Database : Paymo

This is our final project for CS 3700(Introduction to Databases and Modeling) class. It's a group-work done with my classmate, Brady Wheelhouse, and we created a database for payment management system using Oracle data modeler and developer.

### Project Description
"Paymo" is a new money transfer company that needs a database for their operations. The database will need to track clients, senders, receivers, benefits, cards and bank accounts used, and transactions.

## How to run this project
Clone this repostory and run `part3to5.sql` file with Oracle developer.

`master file.pdf` has an overview of this project to help you understand what this project is about.


## Challenge(s) we faced & Features to implement in the future
> 1. _We tried to use PL/SQL to automate a task using a cursor, but it didn't work as we intended although it compiles successfully._
> 2. _We hope to write PL/SQL codes with meaningful function. For example, when we give a client's first name, Oracle shows all attributes with data of that client._
